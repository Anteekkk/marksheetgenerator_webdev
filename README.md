# marksheetgenerator_webdev


This is a basic web development project which allows school or college teachers to upload student marks and student's personal data 
and get a final marksheet report of students.

->>In this project layout of webpages is created using html css and bootstrap.
->>Server of this website is created using nodejs and express framework and ejs frameworks.
->>Database is created on mongod and operations on database are performed using mongoose inside the server file(.js)

This project makes use of basic CRUD operation and mongoose to fetch and extract data to/from database created on mongodb.

It allowed me to get familiar with html,css, bootstrap,javascript, nodejs ,express, mongoose and mongod and gave me good
idea of how backend of websites are created.
